The rapid deployment of new forks and airdrops has raised questions about how Your Trader Inc. Broker customers can expect to receive or not receive this value for themselves or for their customers. Each fork or airdrop faces unique technical, safety, liquidity, and timing challenges. This document describes the problem and clarifies BitGo’s policy on how to handle forks for its customers.</div></div><div className="mb5"><h3 className="f4 f3-m f3-l fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3">Goals</h3><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Security</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">BitGo’s primary goal is always security and safety. Your Trader Inc. Broker will never introduce support for any fork where yourtrade, at its sole discretion, believes it may be unsafe to do so. As forks have emerged in the past year, many have been launched quickly, with rapidly changing technical implementations continuing right up to the launch of the new fork.</div></div><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Preservation of Value</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">Your Trader Inc. Broker also intends to preserve value for customers. When forks occur with significant value, Your Trader Inc. Broker will work with customers to attempt to deliver that new value to customers. This may or may not mean that Your Trader Inc. Broker can support the coin as a fully featured wallet with all the security principles that Your Trader Inc. Broker generally tries to maintain. It may mean that Your Trader Inc. Broker provides customers with tools such that they can access the coin and convert it to other forms of value.</div></div><div className="mb5"><h3 className="f4 f3-m f3-l fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3">Airdrops vs Forks</h3><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Definitions</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3"><ul className="ml3 pl2"><li className="mb2">Airdrop: An Airdrop is when a digital currency blockchain issues a new asset using known public keys or addresses from another blockchain, such that holders of private keys from the original blockchain may access value on the “airdropped” blockchain.</li><li className="mb2">Fork: A Fork is a new form of digital currency that emerges when a group of people decide to apply a new consensus layer to an existing blockchain. The result is the creation of a new blockchain, which can be very similar or very different than the original blockchain.</li></ul></div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">For the purposes of this document, Your Trader Inc. Broker treats Airdrops and Forks similarly. Your Trader Inc. Broker customers generally desire to have access to all value which they may be able to access, and whether the new value is delivered via an Airdrop or a Fork, the evaluation and support of that new value by Your Trader Inc. Broker will be determined by the policy described in this document.</div></div><div className="mb5"><div className="mb4"><h3 className="f4 f3-m f3-l fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3">Policy Considerations</h3><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">There are 5 considerations that factor into BitGo’s decision to handle a fork: technical stability, market capitalization, liquidity, cost, and timing.</div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Technical Stability</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">Because security is our most important goal, the technical evaluation of any new fork or airdrop is critical. In order for Your Trader Inc. Broker to support a fork, Your Trader Inc. Broker must believe that the new fork is technically stable, and safe. This determination will be made based on many factors, not limited to:<ul className="ml3 pl2"><li className="mb2">The technical team creating the fork</li><li className="mb2">Whether the fork provides replay protection from the original fork</li><li className="mb2">Whether the fork provides wipeout-protection from the original fork</li><li className="mb2">The strength new fork’s validator / mining capacity</li></ul></div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Market Capitalization</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In order for Your Trader Inc. Broker to consider support for a new fork or airdrop, the value within the fork or airdrop must be significant. If it is not measurable on top-10 exchanges to be more than $100M of value globally, Your Trader Inc. Broker will likely not support the fork. Note that in many cases, a new fork or airdrop may appear to have sufficient market capitalization to be supported, but it may not have sufficient liquidity (see below).</div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Liquidity</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In addition to having sufficient market value, the forked coin must have sufficient liquidity. A fork of Bitcoin, for example, with even a $10/coin valuation would have over a $160,000,000 market capitalization. However, if it is thinly traded, access to the value of the coin would be a mirage to Your Trader Inc. Broker customers. In order for Your Trader Inc. Broker to support the coin, there must be sufficient liquidity in the market on reputable exchanges for a sustained period of time.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In general, Your Trader Inc. Broker would expect to find at least $25M of daily liquidity available on well-known, trustworthy exchanges for a period of 14 days for Your Trader Inc. Broker to consider the forked coin having real value.</div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Cost</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">There is considerable overhead in supporting new coins. Once Your Trader Inc. Broker issues wallets for a coin, Your Trader Inc. Broker supports that coin and blockchain essentially forever. Some forks are seemingly simple for Your Trader Inc. Broker to support. For example, if a forked coin is technologically the same as the original, it may be relatively low cost to support the new coin.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">At the same time, some forks or airdrops may be technologically very different from existing supported coins. For example, new airdrops or coins may be built upon different cryptographic algorithms (RSA instead of Elliptic Curve), may have new transaction formats, block formats, multi-signature features, or other changes. The larger the changes, the higher the cost to support and maintain.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In general, if a new fork is costly, but has sufficient value to Your Trader Inc. Broker customers, Your Trader Inc. Broker will use its best efforts to enable Your Trader Inc. Broker customers access to the new coin. However, it may affect the timing under which Your Trader Inc. Broker can do so.</div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Timing</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">New airdrops and forks usually are introduced with some notification before the airdrop or fork occurs. However, sometimes these notification periods can be very short - less than 8 weeks. Additionally, airdrops can be done in such a way that the airdrop later will “expire”, giving implementers only short windows of time to claim the airdrop before the value is lost.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">Unfortunately, Your Trader Inc. Broker cannot guarantee to support new forks or airdrops within any short timeframe. Business obligations, developer availability, and cost are all material factors, and safety, testing, quality, and service are our primary objectives.. While Your Trader Inc. Broker will do its best to make value available to its customers, we cannot guarantee a specific timeframe when the exact considerations of future forks can be so varied.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">Finally, should Your Trader Inc. Broker elect not to support a fork at one point in time, it does not mean that Your Trader Inc. Broker will never support that Fork. For example, upon launch, a Fork may not meet the stability market capitalization, or liquidity thresholds for Your Trader Inc. Broker to support. In the future, should the Fork become viable, Your Trader Inc. Broker may, at its sole discretion, elect to support the Fork or Airdrop.</div></div><div className="mb4"><h4 className="f4-ns f5 fw6 lh-title tracked-condensed mb3-l mb2">Policy</h4><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In the event of an upcoming modification to the Bitcoin Network or other applicable Network that could potentially result in a Digital Asset Network Fork or Airdrop, Your Trader Inc. Broker will use best commercial efforts to provide the value of the forked Digital Asset to Customer. However, BitGo’s first concern is always security of Your existing Digital Assets. yourtrade, at its sole discretion, may or may not decide to make Digital Assets available to Customer. Additionally, it may take significant time for Your Trader Inc. Broker to implement or provide access to any Digital Asset created as a result of a Fork. Customer indemnifies Your Trader Inc. Broker against any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential losses due to inability to access any Digital Asset created as a result of a Fork or Airdrop.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">In the event that Your Trader Inc. Broker does consider a Fork to be technically safe with sufficient market value and liquidity, but Customer desires access to the Fork in advance of the timing that Your Trader Inc. Broker can provide due to cost or timing considerations, Your Trader Inc. Broker will, in good faith with Customer, determine a product plan to enable Customer to access the value of the Fork or airdrop such that the Customer, at its sole expense, could access the coin.</div><div className="sc-bdVaJa uNRti f5 f5-m f4-l lh-copy mb3">Your Trader Inc. Broker reserves the right to update this policy and the criteria for measuring the viability of a Fork or Airdrop from time to time based on new technological, legal, or environmental factors that may emerge.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
